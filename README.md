## 🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors Game (HTML, CSS, JS) game project.  

Hey everyone! 👋

I just finished building a **Rock–Paper–Scissors game** from scratch with **0% AI help**.
Afterwards, I polished it a bit — added smoother animations, responsiveness, and better styling.

### ✨ Features

* Play against the computer (first to 3 wins 🏆).
* Responsive design — works nicely on mobile and desktop.
* Smooth expand/collapse for the Rules section.
* Emoji display of choices ✊ ✋ ✌️.
* Highlight for the winning choice each round.
* Restart button resets everything.
* Keyboard shortcuts: press `r`, `p`, or `s` to play quickly.

### 🖼️ Screenshot / Demo

### 📚 What I Learned

* Using event listeners (addEventListener) to make buttons interactive
* Implementing game logic with conditionals (if / else if)
* Updating the DOM dynamically (scores, messages, panels)
* How to manage state (keeping track of current round & total scores)
* A bit of code organization: separating UI logic from game logic

### 🙌 Feedback

I’d love to get feedback on:

* Any ideas to make the UI/UX even smoother?
* Suggestions for adding more fun (like sounds or animations).
* Code style improvements (JavaScript especially).

Thanks for checking out my little project! 🚀
